This folder includes a project I worked on in my Data Structures and Algorithms class at Harvard College, where I implemented Strassen's algorithm for *n*-by-*n* matrix multiplication with large *n*'s. The **2022-CS124-progset2.pdf** file is the detailed assignment instructions. The **strassen.py** is the first part of the assignment, where I implemented a version of the Strassen's algorithm that can handle *n*-by-*n* matrices with odd-numbered *n*. The **triangle.py** is the second part the assignment, where I applied Strassen's to count the number of triangles in random undirected graphs. I built Strassen's from scratch without using any Python packages or built-in matrix multiplication functions. The **P2 Report_Tram Nham.pdf** is my report on the results and my experience with the programming process.

This folder includes a project I worked on in my Data Structures and Algorithms class at Harvard College, where I implemented several randomized algorithms to solve the Number Partition problem. The **2022-CS124-progset3.pdf** file is the detailed assignment instructions. The **heap.py** is my code for building a Maximum Binary Heap from scratch, which would later be used to run the Karmarkar-Karp algorithm. The **partition.py** is where I implemented Karmarkar-Karp and the Repeated Random, Hill Climbing, and Simulated Annealing heuristics to generate random solutions. The **P2 Report_Tram Nham.pdf** is my report on the results, how each algorithm performed compared to each other, and my experience with the programming process.

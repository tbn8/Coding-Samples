This folder includes a project I worked on in my Data Structures and Algorithms class at Harvard College, where I implemented Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms on random 2D, 3D, and 4D complete undirected graphs. The *2022-CS124-projset1.pdf* file is the detailed assignment instructions. The *randmst_prim.cpp* is the code I submitted for grading, where I used Prim's Algorithm to identify a Minimum Spanning Tree. The *randmst_kruskal.cpp* is an alternative version where I used Kruskal's Algorithm instead to test runtime. In both versions, I built graphs and implemented Prim's/Kruskal's from scratch. The *p1 Write-up_Tram Nham.pdf* is my report on the results and my experience with the coding process.

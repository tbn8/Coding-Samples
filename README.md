This repository includes coding samples from my Computer Science/Data Science course projects, and from my health economics research as a Research Assistant at Harvard Medical School. 
I use Stata for econometric analysis, R for matching algorithms, and SAS for cleaning large Medicare/Medicaid/Marketscan claims data and running CMS' risk adjustment models. I use Python and C++ in Data Structures and Algorithms, and in Data Science courses.
